# Sentiments Analysis

This project is a live demo for sentiments analysis based on AFINN-165 and Naive Bayes classifier models.

With this you can classify a text in order to check if it is Positive or Negative.

Also you can train the Bayes model and order to increase its dictionary.

Models and Project are based on **Spanish Language**.
